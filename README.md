# AP Calculus Question Forum 

## Rough Description

Users can create accounts, create questions to post for other users to collaborate on. At posting, questions can be associated with standards according to the AP Calculus Curriculum Framework. The posting user can then edit--including associated standards--and delete their post. Any user may leave comments on any questions.

Users can maintain a list of favorited questions.

Users marked as Administrators can delete posts and create standards.
