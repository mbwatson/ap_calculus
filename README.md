# AP Calculus Question Forum 

## Rough Description

Users can create accounts, create questions to post for other users to collaborate on. At posting, questions can be associated with standards according to the AP Calculus Curriculum Framework. The posting user can then edit--including associated standards--and delete their post. Any user may leave comments on any questions.

Users can maintain a list of favorited questions.

Users marked as Administrators can delete posts and create standards.


### Future Additions/Fixes

- nice-looking pdf export of questions
- live WYSIWYG editor (Ajax, Vue?)
- upload image with question or figure out another option for creating images on the fly
- implement the addition of scoring guidelines with question
- regular conversation forum with categories?
- tag/mention other users (with @-symbol?) in question comments or in regular conversation forum
- tag standards [[LO 1.2A(b)]] or similar in comments
- implement way to distinguish between free response and multiple choice questions
- MC question creation form should provide form inputs for responses (and possibly marking the correct one)
- make profile public, optional
- Question ranking system +/- 1 buttons
- simple way to "suggest" standards without having to write a comment? or is a comment better?
- bootstrap breaking point for navbar--probably need to finalize navbar first
